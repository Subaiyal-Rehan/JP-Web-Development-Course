    <h2 id="bamboo">Bamboo</h2>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Bamboos are a diverse group of mostly evergreen perennial flowering plants making up the subfamily
            Bambusoideae of the grass family Poaceae. Giant bamboos are the largest members of the grass family, in the
            case of Dendrocalamus sinicus individual culms reaching a length of 46 meters, up to 36 centimeters in
            thickness and a weight of up to 450 kilograms. The internodes of bamboos can also be of great length.
            Kinabaluchloa wrayi has internodes up to 2.5 meters in length. and Arthrostylidium schombergkii with lower
            internodes up to 5 meters in length, exceeded in length only by papyrus. By contrast, the culms of the tiny
            bamboo Raddiella vanessiae of the savannas of French Guiana are only 10-20 millimeters in length by about
            two millimeters in width. The origin of the word "bamboo" is uncertain, but it probably comes from the Dutch
            or Portuguese language, which originally borrowed it from Malay or Kannada.</p>

    <h2 id="rose">Rose</h2>
    <blockquote>
        <p>A Rose is either a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus Rosa, in the family Rosacea or the flower it
            bears. There are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars. They form a group of plants
            that can be erect shrubs, climbing, or trailing, with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles. Their
            flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy, in colours ranging from white through
            yellows and reds. Most species are native to Asia, with smaller numbers native to Europe, North America, and
            northwestern Africa. Species, cultivars and hybrids are all widely grown for their beauty and often are
            fragrant. Roses have acquired cultural significance in many societies. Rose plants range in size from
            compact, miniature roses, to climbers that can reach seven meters in height.[ Different species hybridize
            easily, and this has been used in the development of the wide range of garden roses.</p>

    <h2 id="agave">Agave</h2>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Agave is a genus of monocots native to the hot and arid regions of the Americas and the Caribbean, although
            some Agave species are also native to tropical areas of North America, such as Mexico. The genus is
            primarily known for its succulent and xerophytic species that typically form large rosettes of strong,
            fleshy leaves. Agave now includes species formerly placed in a number of other genera, such as Manfreda,
            Mangave, Polianthes and Prochnyanthes.</p>

    <h2 id="lemon">Lemon</h2>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The Lemon is a species of small evergreen tree in the flowering plant family Rutaceae, native to Asia,
            primarily Northeast India (Assam), Northern Myanmar, or China.[The tree's ellipsoidal yellow fruit is used
            for culinary and non-culinary purposes throughout the world, primarily for its juice, which has both
            culinary and cleaning uses. The pulp and rind are also used in cooking and baking. The juice of the lemon is
            about 5-6% citric acid, with a pH of around 2.2, giving it a sour taste. The distinctive sour taste of lemon
            juice, derived from the citric acid, makes it a key ingredient in drinks and foods such as lemonade and
            lemon meringue pie.</p>

        <p>Aloe vera is a succulent plant species of the genus It is widely distributed, and is considered an invasive
            species in many world regions. An evergreen perennial, it originates from the Arabian Peninsula, but grows
            wild in tropical, semi-tropical, and arid climates around the world. It is cultivated for commercial
            products, mainly as a topical treatment used over centuries. The species is attractive for decorative
            purposes, and succeeds indoors as a potted plant.The leaves of Aloe vera contain significant amounts of the
            polysaccharide gel acemannan which can be used for a wide range of medical purposes. The skin contains aloin
            which is toxic. Products made from Aloe vera usually only use the gel. There are many products containing
            aloe vera's acemannan, including skin lotions, cosmetics, ointments and gels for minor burns and skin
            abrasions.</p>
